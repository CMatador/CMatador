# Hello, and Welcome! &#128075;

My name is Christopher Kusha, I'm a Data Analyst based out of New York City currently seeking opportunities. You can find me on [LinkedIn][1].

## Data Analysis Projects

Here are some projects I am working on:

**Examining Employee Attrition**

In this project I analyzed an employee dataset to find subsections of the company with high attrition rates with the goal of communicating these findings to executives who can then decide how to address the company turnover.

Future Plans:
- [ ] Conduct further analysis in SQL and create a tableau dashboard
- [ ] Repeat process in MS Excel and create a report in MS Powerpoint

**Covid Data Exploration**
