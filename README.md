# Hello, and Welcome! &#128075;

My name is Christopher Kusha, I'm a Data Analyst based out of New York City currently seeking opportunities. You can find me on [LinkedIn][1].

## Data Analysis Projects

### Examining Employee Attrition

In this project I analyzed an employee dataset to find subsections of the company with high attrition rates with the goal of communicating these findings to executives who can then decide how to address the company turnover. Note: data was altered for privacy reasons.

Future Plans:
- [ ] Conduct further analysis in SQL and create a tableau dashboard
- [ ] Repeat process in MS Excel and create a report in MS Powerpoint

### Covid Data Exploration

For this, I acquired data on the COVID-19 pandemic and used it to do exploratory data analysis in SQL, creating queries that would be used to create a dashboard in Tableau. The main points of focus were the number and percentage of people infected, percentage of infections that resulted in death, as well as a heat map of the highest infected regions, along with projections for the future (as of Aug '21).
