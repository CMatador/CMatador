# Hello, and Welcome! &#128075;

My name is Christopher Kusha, I'm a Data Analyst based out of New York City currently seeking opportunities. You can find me on [LinkedIn][1].

## Data Analysis Projects

### [Exploring Crime and Effects on Education in Chicago][6]

Here I worked with a small team to:
- Build a SQL database of historical crime data in chicago
- Develop a data pipeline using an API and Kafka to automatically add new crimes to the database
- Create an interactive dashboard using the gathered data
- Analayze trends and find correlations between crimes and school incidents in various districts
- Gather findings and present to an audience of both technical and non-technical people

### [Visualizing the 2019 Business Survey using Census API Data][7]

Worked in a small group to gather data from the census API, clean the data, analyze various trends in business owner demographics, revenue brackets, and technology usage.

### [Examining Employee Attrition][2]

In this project I analyzed an employee dataset to find subsections of the company with high attrition rates with the goal of communicating these findings to executives who can then decide how to address the company turnover. Note: data was altered for privacy reasons.

### Covid Data Exploration

For this, I acquired data on the COVID-19 pandemic and used it to do exploratory data analysis in SQL, creating queries that would be used to create a dashboard in Tableau. The main points of focus were the number and percentage of people infected, percentage of infections that resulted in death, as well as a heat map of the highest infected regions, along with projections for the future (as of Aug '21).
